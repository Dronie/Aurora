		<description>
			<p>This gauntlet has three small openings set into a raised piece on the top. It contains three poison darts that can be fired by pressing a small button on the underside of the gauntlet. The craftmanship is such that this can be operated with one hand. You may only fire this weapon if you have a free hand to press the button. For example if you are wielding two melee weapons then you are not able to fire.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Poison:</strong> On a hit a creature must make a DC13 Constitution saving throw, on a failed save the creature takes 1d8 poison damage and is Poisoned.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Reloading:</strong> Once all three shots have been fire you must spend 1 whole turn reloading. If you are within melee range you are left open for Opportunity Attack.</p>

			<p>This magical hand axe was forged as part of a pair known as Smoke and Fire. Created from quicksilver by Gnomish Artificers, it has grey crystal shards embedded in the blade. After repeated ignition the blade becomes covered in soot so that only the crystal shards shine through. Whether one or both weapons is owned attunement only takes up one slot.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Weighted:</strong> Made of quicksilver, the balance of this weapon shifts as you use it; allowing it to swing faster and hit harder. You gain +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Ignite:</strong> When attuned, and if both Smoke and Fire are equipped, you may use a bonus action to strike them together and ignite them. Once ignited they deal and additional 1d4 fire damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Conceal:</strong> When attuned, this weapon has two charges that it regains each day at sunset. Using an action you can expend one of the charges to cast the spell Fog Cloud on this weapon. The cloud will remain up to and hour and remains centered on your weapon for the duration.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A <strong>Quake Hammer</strong> is a highly advanced hybrid mix of the almighty warhammer and newly developed seismic gunpownder charges. On it's own, the Hammer is powerful. It is able to fold enemies in two with powerful smashes capable of leveling plate armor, large beasts such as horses and even the most heaviy fortified foes.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roughly the same length as a greatsword, the quake hammer contains - along it's shaft - two seperate grips including a guard for the off hand on the lower half. The hammerhead has two clear parts: a simple, square, flattened end for regular usage and then another more intricate end which is dome-like in construction compiled of several rings, all with the abilty to rotate freely. When the small circular heatch is opened at the apex of the dome and a charge is inserted, the Quake Hammer can activate the explosive and channel the released energy into the next attack, triggering upon impact of the head meeting a solid object.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Seismic</em>:</strong> Using this feature requires the purchase of a seismic gunpowder charge. Each charge has 3 uses. <strong>Loading</strong> the charge into the quake hammer is a <strong>standard action</strong> which provokes an attack of opportunity. The amount of time and effort taken to reload a Quake Hammer is affected by the Rapid Reload feat.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once the charge is loaded, priming it is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. After this, the next hit landed upon a solid surface, including environment and enemies, will deal an <strong>extra 1d6</strong> on top of weapon damage. You may only have one charge primed at any one time. It may be discharged harmlessly as a free action.</p>
			<p class="indent">Instead of targeting a singular foe, the character may instead choose to strike the ground, creating a miniature earthquake. All creatures on the ground within 10 feet of the wielder must succeed on a dexterity saving throw of DC12 + the character's strength modifier or take 1d6 + the character's strength modifier in damage. All targets affected by the damage must then roll a Constitution save DC equal to the damage dealt or be knocked prone.</p>

			<p>This bow was forged from quicksilver by Gnomish Artificers. It includes two small pouches, one on either side of the grip, each of which contains a unique bow string. Additionally the bow has two crystals inlaid under the grip which, when held, are positioned under the index finger and middle finger.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Weighted</em>:</strong> Made of quicksilver, the balance of this weapon shifts as you use it; making the bow easier to draw and aim. You gain +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Bow Strings</em></strong></p>
			<p class="indent">This bow includes two different bow strings, one is a glistening silver thread that thrums with magical energy. The other is a crimson red and always feels warm to the touch. <strong>You may only use one action to change the bow string</strong>.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Silver String</em>:</strong> Whilst this string is in use the crystals inlaid in the grip begin to glow, one has a shimmering golden hue, the other has a grey foggy apperance.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em>Conceal</em>: When attuned, this weapon has two charges that it regains each day at <strong>sunset</strong>. Using your bonus action you can press the grey crystal, this activates one of the charges, when you next fire an arrow it becomes chraged with the spell <em>fog cloud</em>. On impact the arrow releases the spell. The cloud will remain up to an hour and is centered on the point of impact.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em>Reveal</em>: When attuned, this weapon has two charges that it regains each day at <strong>sinrise</strong>. Using your bonus action you can press the grey crystal, this activates one of the charges, when you next fire an arrow it becomes chraged with the spell <em>daylight</em>. On impact the arrow releases the spell. The light will remain up to an hour and is centered on the point of impact.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Crimson String</em>:</strong> Whilst this string is in use the crystals fade and the bow becoms hot to the touch. Any arrow fired from this weapon immediately ignites and deals an additional <em>1d4 fire damage</em>.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Attunement</em></strong></p>
			<p class="indent">You must spent at least 1 hour getting to this weapon, this can be done during either a short or long rest. If you are separated from this weapon by more than 100ft. or for more that 1 day your attunement is lost.</p>
			<p class="indent">Until you are attuned with this weapon, it behaves like a standard +1 shortbow.</p>
