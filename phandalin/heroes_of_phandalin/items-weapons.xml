			<p>This magical hand axe was forged as part of a pair known as Smoke and Fire. Created from quicksilver by Gnomish Artificers, it has grey crystal shards embedded in the blade. After repeated ignition the blade becomes covered in soot so that only the crystal shards shine through. Whether one or both weapons is owned attunement only takes up one slot.</p>
			<p><b>Weighted</b>. Made of quicksilver, the balance of this weapon shifts as you use it; allowing it to swing faster and hit harder. You gain +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p><b>Ignite</b>. When attuned, and if both Smoke and Fire are equipped, you may use a bonus action to strike them together and ignite them. Once ignited they deal and additional 1d4 fire damage.</p>
			<p><b>Conceal</b>. When attuned, this weapon has two charges that it regains each day at sunset. Using an action you can expend one of the charges to cast the spell Fog Cloud on this weapon. The cloud will remain up to and hour and remains centered on your weapon for the duration.</p>
