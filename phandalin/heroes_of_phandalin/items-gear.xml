			<p>This circlet is made of wood carved with feathers, a small stone in the shape of a crescent moon is inlaid over the forhead.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Once per day</strong> you can concentrate on making a ranged attack. When you do, the moon begins to glow with a dim light. The magic imbues your weapon with Celestial energy and <strong>turns any hit into a critical hit</strong>.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you roll a 20 when your weapon is charged in this way, you deal an extra <strong>1d10 radiant damage</strong>.</p>

	<element name="Cockatoo Coin Pouch" type="Magic Item" source="Heroes of Phandalin" id="ID_CN_HOP_ITEM_COCKATOO_COIN_POUCH">
		<description>
			<p>This pouch has been decorated to resemble a cockatoo and produces occational, soft, chirping sounds. The pouch can hold up to 1,000 coins, but weights 1 pound, regardless of its contents. It becomes bound to you when you speak it's command word. If the pouch is already bound to a different creature, that creature needs to speak the command work first to break it's bond to the pouch.</p>
			<p class="indent"> When a creature that isn't you opens the coin pouch it gives off a loud shrieking, audible from as far away as 300 feet, until you colse the pouch.</p>
			<p class="indent">Objects placed in the pouch which aren't coins come out shredded or battered, as if pecked apart.</p>
